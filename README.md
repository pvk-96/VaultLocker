## 🚧 Project: VaultLock – In Progress

Hey there 👋

I'm **Praneeth Varma K** (pvk-96), and I'm currently working on a secure offline vault desktop app built entirely with **Python**.

🔐 **VaultLock** is designed as a personal document manager + vault that:
- Lets users **store and open** files like PDFs, DOCX, Markdown, etc.
- Provides a **password-protected UI** to keep files safe
- Will work **offline** and export as a cross-platform desktop app using tools like `tkinter` or `PyQt` and `PyInstaller`

This is a **3-day solo build** to challenge myself to:
- Plan and ship a full-featured Python desktop application
- Work with file parsing, GUI, encryption, and multi-format support
- Document and version each meaningful step (check commit history!)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- `tkinter` or `PyQt5`
- `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`, `markdown`, `cryptography`
- `PyInstaller` for packaging

### ⏳ Current Status
- [x] Day 1: Planning & file parsing prototyping
- [ ] Day 2: UI layout, file interaction
- [ ] Day 3: Packaging, README polish, testing

I'll be posting updates here and on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/praneeth-varma-kopperla), so stay tuned!
